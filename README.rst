# Spiking Neural P System Simulator

This repository contains a simulator for **Spiking Neural P Systems** (SNPS) developed in collaboration with the University of Verona.  
The project explores SNPS with a high degree of realism, serving as a framework for both theoretical research and experimental applications.

The simulator allows users to:

- generate and load P systems, 
- run simulations and modify weights/rules,  
- compute energy costs,  
- analyze structural and performance aspects.  

See more documentation in the `Technical_info.pdf` file.  

The initial fork was taken from [spiking-p-system](https://github.com/a1sabau/spiking-p-system).
