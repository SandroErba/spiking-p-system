Spiking Neural P System Simulator
=================================

This repository contains a simulator for **Spiking Neural P Systems** (SNPS) developed in collaboration with the University of Verona.

The initial fork was taken from `spiking-p-system <https://github.com/a1sabau/spiking-p-system>`_.

Features
--------

- generate and load P systems
- run simulations and modify weights/rules
- compute energy costs
- analyze structural and performance aspects
